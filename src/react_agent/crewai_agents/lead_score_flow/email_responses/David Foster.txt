Subject: Thank You for Your Application

Dear David,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for taking the time to apply for the position at CrewAI and for sharing your impressive background with us. We truly appreciate your experience as a mid-level React developer, particularly your work with responsive web applications and your recent exploration of AI integrations using the Vercel AI SDK.

After careful consideration, we have decided to move forward with other candidates at this time. This decision was not easy, given your qualifications and the potential contribution you could make to our team. Please don’t take this as a reflection of your abilities; competition was strong, and we had to make some difficult choices.

We encourage you to apply for future openings that match your skills and interests. We believe you have much to offer, and we’d love to keep your application on file.

Thank you once again for your time, and we wish you the best of luck in your job search.

Warm regards,

Sarah  
HR Coordinator  
CrewAI
